A representation of the words in a phrase or passage, irrespective of order. For example, bag of words represents the following three phrases identically:

- the dog jumps
- jumps the dog
- dog jumps the
- Each word is mapped to an index in a sparse vector, where the vector has an index for every word in the vocabulary. For example, the phrase the dog jumps is mapped into a feature vector with non-zero values at the three indices corresponding to the words the, dog, and jumps. The non-zero value can be any of the following:

- A 1 to indicate the presence of a word.
- A count of the number of times a word appears in the bag. For example, if the phrase were the maroon dog is a dog with maroon fur, then both maroon and dog would be represented as 2, while the other words would be represented as 1.
- Some other value, such as the logarithm of the count of the number of times a word appears in the bag.
